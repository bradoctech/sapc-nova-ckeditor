# Migration

### **From 5.3.0 to 5.4.0**

The `AudioPicker` feature has been introduced to the ckeditor field.

To activate this functionality, you need to republish the migrations, models and resources.

Execute the following command:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bradoctech\SapcNovaCkEditor\FieldServiceProvider"
```

This command will generate two classes for Audio in `Models` and `App\Nova\Resources` directories, along with a migration file for the audio table.



After running the `php artisan migrate` command to create the audio table, follow these additional steps:

1. Add the following properties to `config/nova-ckeditor.php` file (Check [the latest](https://github.com/bradoctech/sapc-nova-ckeditor/blob/master/config/nova-ckeditor.php) version of the config for reference):
   * audio-naming-method
   * toolbars.toolbar-1.browser.audio
   * toolbars.toolbar-1.items.audioBrowser
2. Create a disk drive in your `filesystems.php`

{% code title="config/filesystems.php" %}
```php
'disks' => [
    'audio' => [
        'driver'     => 'local',
        'root'       => public_path('uploads/audio'),
        'url'        => env('APP_URL') . '/uploads/audio',
    ]
]
```
{% endcode %}



That's it. You're done.
